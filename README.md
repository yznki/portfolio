**Software Engineer · Building crisp, human-centered digital experiences**

Welcome to my portfolio. I pair engineering rigor with product instinct to ship work that feels intentional—whether it’s AI-powered apps, internal automation, or polished consumer experiences.

## What I Do
- Craft end-to-end products: discovery, UX flows, and production-ready code.
- Build elegant, performant interfaces with Nuxt/Vue and Tailwind.
- Shape API-first systems and automation that keep teams moving fast.
- Bridge engineering and design so complex ideas stay approachable.

## Snapshot of My Journey
- MindTech — Software Engineer (Vienna): AI-driven mobile/web apps and APIs.
- Infineon Technologies — Software Engineer Consultant & Intern (Villach): internal automation and validation tooling.
- Sager Drone — Product Owner & Engineer (Amman): autonomous flight systems, control UX, and cross-functional leadership.
